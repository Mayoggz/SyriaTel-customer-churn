    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, is experiencing customer churn, which means customers are stopping their service and going to competitors.

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "SyriaTel wants to reduce customer churn to increase their revenue and customer retention. By predicting which customers are likely to leave, SyriaTel can take proactive measures to retain them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "1. To develop a churn prediction model that accurately predicts customers at a high risk of churning,\n",
    "2. To identify key factors influencing churn.\n",
    "3. To reduce customer churn rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics of Success\n",
    "- Accuracy: The percentage of correctly predicted churned and non-churned customers.\n",
    "- Precision: The proportion of customers predicted to churn who actually churn.\n",
    "- Recall: The proportion of actual churned customers identified by the model.\n",
    "- F1-score: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.\n",
    "\n",
